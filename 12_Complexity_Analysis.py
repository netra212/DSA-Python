# Docstring for 12_Complexity_Analysis

- Complexity - A factor involved in complicated process or situation. 

# Time Complexity:
- Can you tell the time complexity of code that you have written. 
- Can you improve the Complexity. 

# ----- Asymptotic notation -----

- Main idea of our analysis is to do have a measure of the efficiency of algorithm that don't depend on. 
- machine specific constants. 
- require algorithm to be implemented. 

- Asymptotic notation are mathematic tools to represent time complexity of our algorithm.
